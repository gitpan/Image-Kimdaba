This is a perl module Image::Kimdaba.pm which allows quick extensions
to kimdaba, and some scripts that use this.

To install it :
	
	$ perl -MCPAN -e shell
	follow the instructions. 
	then type :
	install Image::Kimdaba

(Note: if you want to install it all locally, say "PREFIX=~/local"
and set the environment variable :

	$ export PERL5LIB=~

and set the environment variable :

	$ export PERL5LIB=~/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.8.3:~/local/lib/perl5/5.8.3

see ~/local/lib/perl5/ to know how to adapt it to your version of perl)

To make your own extensions, see 
    - "kim_example.pl"
    - "kim_example_modifydb.pl"

Here we describe scripts already made that you may find useful.

    The first time, do :
$ ./kim_2_digikam <rootfolder>
    it will create the digikam.db database used by digikam >= 0.7

    Launch kimdaba, do some changes, relaunch the script
$ ./kim_2_digikam <rootfolder>
    it will update the digikam.db database
    (you have to restart digikam to see the changes, though)

    Add some categories in Digikam to some pictures
    and relaunch the script
$ ./kim_2_digikam <rootfolder>
    Then you can import the modications you made with Digikam
    by doing in Kimdaba :
	File -> import : /tmp/digikam_export.kim	

The good thing with synchroniyzing with digikam.db
is that you can then use the "digikamtags:/" KIOSlave
to browse by Persons/Keywords/Locations in every KDE app.
(And add a tab "Kimdaba" => url=digikamtags:/ in Konqueror slidebar
for example).


    * Auto-assign categoryimages (for the "see by icons view" in Kimdaba's browser)
$ ./kim_category_images  <rootfolder>
    It's faster than to set the 500 pictures by hand, isn't it ?
    You can still use the category editor to choose a better picture for
    this person or that keyword, the script will not overwrite it.

    * Really rotate your pictures
(needs the jpegtran tool)
$ ./kim_rotate.pl <rootfolder>

PS: someone to convert also the persons/keywords/locations, the date
if it has changed, the comment ? perhaps imagemagick would help.

    * kim_bestof (see the script to customize it)
I put the keyword "+++" on my best pictures, this allows me to always
show to my friends a beautiful diaporama. This very small script does
symbolic links of all those pictures in one directory. Then I configured 
KDE control > look and feel > Wallpaper to do a diaporama of the 
pictures contained in this folder.
    
    * Export a hierarchy of symbolic links 
    (a bit proof-of-concept for Kimdaba.pm, but could be useful when using
     non kde apps (see kim_2_digikam ))
Edit the first line of the script, then     
$ ./kim_2_filesystem <rootfolder>
